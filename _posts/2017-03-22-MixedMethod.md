title: How to conduct a mixed-method (Stage1)
---

**Title:**
Discovering adolescents' self-concept and the factors that influence them in China 

**Research Topic:**
I am interested in exploring how rapid  social change influences the  adolescents’ self-concept , which can be defined as how individuals perceive themselves. I am motivated to study the topic because I have witnessed enormous social change in China during my development, which makes me curious about how these macro-level social changes along with the introduction of western cultural values lead to micro-level changes. 

**Mixed Method: **
How does social change influence adolescents’ self-concept in China?

**Qualitative:**
How do Chinese adolescents perceive themselves in different social contexts? 

-	How do adolescents perceive themselves in urban areas?
-	How do adolescents perceive themselves in rural areas?

Note: I am considering to use the Twenty-Statement-Test to examine the self-concept, which contains twenty open-ended questions beginning with “I am.”While quanlitative method can yield quantitative data, in this case, I will try to think TST in a more qualitative way, which gives me more freedom to get rich information. In this sense, qualitative can give me a picture of "how the self-concepts differ" and"what might be the underlying reasons."

- quantitative analysis: create a coding book and calculate the frequency 
- qualitative analysis: find the themes and also consider to conduct focus groups after TST to get more information about why they describe themselves in this way. 

In this qualitative part, I can collect the information about the possible different patterns and the possible reasons. 


**Quantitative: **

-  Do the self-concepts of adolescents from urban and rural areas differ? (quantitative scale)
-  What are the sociocultural factors(e.g., usage of technology, time distribution) that influence  adolescents’ self concepts? 


Note: I am planning to conduct surveys to collect information regarding the adolescents’ socio cultural aspects of life, including the frequency of technology usage, the time distribution, and the habits (needs more consideration). Also plan to use another self-concpet scale to collect data.

**Summary**

In this case, research questions of two strand match each other and can provide the full story. 

In mixed method research, one thing is worth noticing is that they tend to have **different sample size** as qualitative method tends to be time-consuming and labor-intensive. Thus, after getting the results of two parts, **we cannot simply merge them togeter**. If we are going to write a paper, in the discussion part, one of the most important thing to do is to link the qualitativ and quantitative results together. Also remember to use the relevant theories or findings from existing literature. Thus, when it comes to analysis, we must give a clear description of data-collection(e.g., randomized selecction) in case we cannot use all of collected data. 

Here are a few suggestions relevant to research implementation:

1. In the interview part, sometimes you will reach the saturation, which means that further interviews may not give you new information. Thus, try to keep the awareness when conducting focus groups, which may save a lot of time. Also be aware of the sample size. 

2. For quantitative researches, researchers may want to generalize their results to the population. However, qualitative researchers may not intend to generalize but to make meaning of the results and provide possible explanations, which may be** transferable to the certain contexts(e.g., developing Asian countries undergoing socia change). **

3. Regarding how to engage in the contexts and conduct participatory researches, give students choices and motivate them with rewards (e.g., snacks, gifts). The most important thing to keep in mind is that participants are experts and the researchers are the people who want to know how those experts think **(mitigate the power position)**. Remember no one makes them do that ( this rationale may be easily forgotten, especially in China)

4. Focus groups may be better than individual interviews, which may give positive peer pressure and release the negative pressure. 

5. Because of the complexity of administration division in China (many government levels), researchers may operationlize rural areas/urban areas based on some reasonable criteria (singular.criterion), for example, income-level.

6. Be clear about the recurring themes in the research, in this study, e.g., urbanization, industrilization, self-concept, identity. Be alert. 

7. According to the common sense, qualitative research is more about theory-generating while quantitative is about theory-testing.

For this assignment, please include:
 
- A draft title for your research study (1 point)
 
- A revised short write-up of your research topic  (based on assignment #1, and the feedback that you received on this assignment).  (1 point)

 
- Next, based on your title and purpose, please include your research questions.
o You should have at least one central QUAL RQ (exploring the central phenomenon of a study), as well as some associated sub-questions.
(1 point)
o You should have at least one QUANT RQ or HYPOTHESIS. (1 point)
o And you should have at least one MM RQ (1 point)
 
Remember that

-  QUAL RQs generally ask “how” or “what” and use exploratory verbs.
-  QUANT RQs “inquire about the relationships among variables” (Creswell, p. 143)
-  QUANT HYPOTHESES “are predictions…about the expected outcomes of relationships among variables” (Creswell, p. 143).
o  And, in general, for QUANT strands of a MM study, we write only RQs or Hypotheses, not both.
-  MM RQs “directly address the mixing of the QUANT and QUAL strands of the research.” (Creswell, p. 149) You can think of these as “hybrid” or “integrated” questions. (See Creswell, pp 148-151 for details.)
