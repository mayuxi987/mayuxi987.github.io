Title:
Discovering adolescents' self-concept and the factors that influence them in China 

Research Topic:
I am interested in exploring how rapid  social change influences the  adolescents’ self-concept , which can be defined as how individuals perceive themselves. I am motivated to study the topic because I have witnessed enormous social change in China during my development, which makes me curious about how these macro-level social changes along with the introduction of western cultural values lead to micro-level changes. 

Mixed Method: 
How does social change influence adolescents’ self-concept in China?

Qualitative:
How do Chinese adolescents perceive themselves in different social contexts? 

-	How do adolescents perceive themselves in urban areas?
-	How do adolescents perceive themselves in rural areas?

Note: I am considering to use the Twenty-Statement-Test to examine the self-concept, which contains twenty open-ended questions beginning with “I am.”While quanlitative method can yield quantitative data, in this case, I will try to think TST in a more qualitative way, which gives me more freedom to get rich information. 



Quantitative: 
-	Do the self-concepts of adolescents from urban and rural areas differ? What are the sociocultural factors(e.g., usage of technology, time distribution) that influence  adolescents’ self concepts? 
Note: I am planning to conduct surveys to collect information regarding the adolescents’ socio cultural aspects of life, including the frequency of technology usage, the time distribution, and the habits (needs more consideration).
