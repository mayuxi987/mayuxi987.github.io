## Clustering 
structural discovery 

### K-means

- The final clusters depend on the choosing of initial centroids
- center

- Distortion 
- work for random restart points
- does not work for choosing size ( more clusters often lead to smaller distortioin) 
- cross-validation cannot solve the problem
- **solution** penalize models with more clusters, according to how much extra fit would be expected form the additonal cluster (bayesian information criterian, AIC)

### advanced clustering algorithms


### factor analysis 

- find how data features/variables together
