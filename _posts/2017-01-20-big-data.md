## Clustering 
structural discovery 

### K-means

- **prcedures**
  
  + decide the number of clusters
  + find initial starting points - centroids ( usually random )
  + label data points that close to a certain centroid as one cluster，e.g.,Cluster0 ( use voronoi diagram )
  + refit the centroids in each cluster (e.g., Centroid A) in a certain cluster ( in every coordinate, calculate the average value of all data points in that cluster ） - the process called *convergence*
  + repeat until the centroids remain the same

- **notes**

  1. with different initial centroids, the final clusters will differ.   
   + ramdonly try several initial starting points and get several restarts
   + use distortion to determine which restart works best. 
  
  2. to determine which group of clusters of 


- The final clusters depend on the choosing of initial centroids
- Distortion 
- work for random restart points
- does not work for choosing size ( more clusters often lead to smaller distortioin) 
- cross-validation cannot solve the problem
- **solution** penalize models with more clusters, according to how much extra fit would be expected form the additonal cluster (bayesian information criterian, AIC)

### advanced clustering algorithms


### factor analysis 

- find how data features/variables together
